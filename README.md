# 🔢 Sorting Visualizer

An interactive, beautifully animated web app that demonstrates how popular sorting algorithms work in real-time. Built with DSA learning in mind, it uses color-coded bars and step-by-step animation to help visualize sorting concepts clearly.

  - Counting Sort
  - Radix Sort
  - Bucket Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- 🎨 Color-coded visualization:
  - 🔵 Blue: Default state
  - 🟡 Yellow: Elements being compared
  - 🔴 Red: Incorrectly positioned elements (to be swapped)
  - 🟢 Green: Correctly placed (sorted) elements — shown **as they are sorted**
- ⚙️ Adjustable array size
- 🐇 Adjustable algorithm speed
- 📊 Time complexity display
- 🔁 Live comparison counter
- 🧑‍💻 Clean responsive UI with modern design

## 📘 How It Uses DSA Concepts

This project isn't just about visualization — it is deeply rooted in **core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts, such as:

### ✅ **Data Structures**
- **Arrays**: Used to store and manipulate the elements during sorting.
- **Auxiliary arrays**: For non-comparison sorts like Counting and Radix Sort.

### ✅ **Algorithms**
Each sorting algorithm is implemented from scratch using standard DSA techniques:
- **Comparison-based sorts**: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick
- **Non-comparison sorts**: Counting, Radix, Bucket
- **Recursive logic**: Merge Sort and Quick Sort use recursion with divide & conquer.

### ✅ **Algorithmic Analysis**
- Tracks **number of comparisons** for performance insight.
- Displays **time complexity** per selected algorithm (`O(n²)`, `O(n log n)`, etc.).
- Demonstrates **algorithm efficiency**, use cases, and step-by-step transitions.

📌 This makes the visualizer a strong educational tool for:
- Understanding sorting logic
- Learning algorithm design
- Grasping complexity analysis
- Justifying practical application of DSA
